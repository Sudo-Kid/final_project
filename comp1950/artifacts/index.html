Planning?
Site Map rationale for using draw.io for sitemap - after fighting with sign up and learning curves of tools like Gliffy and Idea Sketch, opted for free, no sign in and easy to share in variety of extensions, .png, .jpeg, .pdf and option to collaborate through Drive if desired

Wireframe Rationale?  dynamic wireframing session with chat - was that Google Lesson?
Screen
-Home page
-Lecture
-Blog
Mobile
Print

Communications
Each team member resonsible for specific items and have athread on google forum and then we will do a peer reiview once substantial completion of our individual tasks


Rationale on design (this are only ideas I am thinking of including)

F-Shaped pattern for reading web development
http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/
---------------- Lolit


Content

1. CMS
Lolit to expand on wordpress proposal or perhaps we can expand on 

2. BLOG - TUMBLR - why did we decide this?

3. FORUM
Edward. Emett, Lolit - what is this about? please explain

4. FOOTER
Tools resources and links content was imported from spreadsheet

5.  LECTURES
Lectures imported from existing lectures

Presentation
1.eg reference wireframe and explain why the layout is different (if in fact it turns out to be much different - the rational could be that minimal change is necessary)
2.  Why doesnt the current course site reflect the design of BCIT ?  here is master css for BCIT - makes for good rationale on what font, color
http://www.bcit.ca/_Website_Settings/v4_global.css
3. Stylesheets
boxmodel.css
styles.css
@import name.css
@import edward.css
teammembername.css
print.css - Edward 
-section and article only
mobile.css - Edward to action

4. Navigation - Emett 
- MAIN NAV Drop down
-SECONDARY NAV accordian style

5. Header - Emett
header.php

6. Footer - Emett
footer.php - see content spread sheet




Behaviour
1.search (not sure if this is behaviour or presentation, if javascript it sort of falls into behaviour by default, if google search probably falls into presentation) 
2. sexifiy the navigation (drop down, pop out, explode) to give overview of content of the link - Emett to explain the jQuery you use

3.media queries 



Hardware/Server Stuff
